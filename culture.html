      <h2>Imazeghen culture in Morocco, between tradition and modernity</h2>
      <h3>Berber culture is essentially oral</h3>
      <p>
        The Berbers call themselves “Amazigh”, men, free men, and it is the
        same word, in the feminine, Tamazight, which designates the language.
        The Berber culture is defined first by its language , even if today,
        one can still be Berber by being only Arabic-speaking. (And the
        Amazigh movements have united around the defense of the language. The
        teaching or not, the transcription in one system of characters or
        another carry at the same time political stakes).
      </p>
      <p>
        This language has an alphabet, Tifinagh, which had fallen into
        oblivion and until the 1960s was only used in its archaic version by
        the Tuaregs. After independence, the system of transcription in Latin
        characters was abandoned, and IRCAM set up a modern tifinagh, which is
        used today in Morocco.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the Berber culture, for centuries, was a culture of orality, that
        of the stories that we exchange when we find ourselves at the oasis,
        those of the tales on the eve of the camp fire, of the proverbs, and
        the marching songs, during long desert crossings.
      </p>
      <p>
        And this love of the verb is found in the songs, often embroidered and
        modified around an existing plot, depending on the audience, depending
        on what is happening in the village... just like the women's songs,
        those which punctuate the works of singing, the innumerable turns of
        the millstone to prepare the flour for couscous and the vocal jousts
        that are sung at weddings.
      </p>
      <h3>A culture that dates back to "before history"</h3>

      <p>
        The components of the Berber culture are numerous, diverse, but their
        amalgamation reveals the different origins. The Berbers were in the
        Maghreb before the Romans, and they take their Julian calendar from
        them, and probably their carnival rites, which now take place during
        Achoura.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were, before being converted to Islam, pagans, worshipers of
        springs and trees, and perhaps held from the Phoenicians – who had
        opened counters as far away as Mauritania – their respect for the
        moon. Some tribes were converted to Judaism, and it is said that the
        Kahina, this Berber queen of the Aures who resisted the Arab armies
        for so long, was a Jewish queen, arguing that her name is close to
        Kahen or Cohen.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is difficult to date the arrival of the Berbers, yet the culture
        has remained very strong over the centuries, and for those who have
        lived in Morocco for a little while, it is easy to say whether such a
        woman is Berber or Arab. , to his clothes, to recognize, even without
        speaking the language, the difference between Berber and Arabic, whose
        sounds are different, even if the languages are close.
      </p>
      <p>
        Between the Tuaregs, the Rifians, the Kabyles, the Chleuhs and the
        Amazighs (or Imazighen), of course, there are many differences, but a
        common background, a relatively democratic social organization, where
        the chiefs were elected, where, as among the Celts, each family, each
        tribe, each fraction was too independent to be able to unite with the
        others, and preferred to cut itself in two as soon as it reached a
        certain size, a common fund also in the artistic motifs, these
        geometric decorations whose abstraction dates back to before Islam,
        and whose forms recall, again, Celtic motifs.
      </p>
      <p>
        For more than two thousand years, the Amazigh culture has resisted
        assimilation, or rather, negotiated with its neighbors, in order to
        always be able to exist. This is probably why, very often, at the
        bottom of a small village, or in the tent of a nomad, one has the
        impression that time is no longer the same, and that one is gone on a
        strange journey, which takes us back to ancient times.
      </p>
      <h3>Nomadic traditions and peasant traditions</h3>

      <p>
        Traditional medicine, charms that protect young children are those of
        people who roamed the country.
      </p>
      <p>
        The alliances, friendships and hatreds between tribes are linked to
        the sharing of water and that of pastures, to cooperation and to the
        battles for the rare green valleys in a semi-desert country. And all
        this is found in the carpets that the young girls wove for their
        wedding.
      </p>
      <p>
        And in the cities, even if the language is lost, the link remains
        strong with the family who remained in the 'bled' (in the
        countryside), with the traditions transmitted by the parents, the
        grandparents, and we find the "Berber touch in many things of everyday
        life.
      </p>
      <h3>Very present traditions, even in a modern world.</h3>
      <p>
        Of course, depending on whether you are in a big city or in a small
        village, traditions are lived differently on a daily basis, but they
        are always followed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether for traditional festivals, for weddings or births, as part of
        daily life, Berber culture is present. And in the south, especially,
        it is common to see women still dressed in traditional clothes, or
        wearing festive makeup with henna or saffron.

        Traditional songs resonate in the streets of the ksours, the carpets
        are still made with centenary patterns, the jewels are lighter and
        adapt to modern life while keeping their decorations.
      </p>
      <h3>Modernize without betraying yourself</h3>
      <h4>Write Amazigh</h4>
      <p>
        On the one hand, Amazigh benefits from technology. With its utf-8
        alphabet it accesses the internet. What was complex twenty years ago,
        requiring the installation of specialized typefaces, is now easy.
        Amazigh is a language in Windows settings, it has several codes in the
        ISO 639-2 and 639-3 standards used to define language files in
        computerized processes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>“ ber ” for Amazigh in general</li>
        <li>“ kab ” for Kabyle</li>
        <li>" tmh " for Tamasheq</li>
        <li>“ zgh ” for Moroccan Amazigh</li>
      </ul>
