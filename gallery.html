        <h2>history status</h2>
        <p>In general, ancient tifinagh is considered to be very close to the current tifinagh of Ahaggar
            (Algeria) and Ajjer (Algeria/Libya) (Claudot Award: 2011 ), and today's Tuaregs are able to
            read and interpret it.
        </p>

                <div class="desc">Indeed, it was the Tuaregs who continued to use Tifinagh and it is thanks to them that
                    this
                    alphabet was able to survive until today.One can distinguish slight differences from one region
                    to another , but even so, texts written in one region can be easily read and understood
                    in another.On the other hand, Tifinagh characters have been used to decorate both women's jewelry
                    and men's weapons and also to write small texts and love poems.</div>

                    while
                    maintaining consistency at the morphological and structural level.In the Libyan writing
                    composed of 24 signs , the vowels are not transcribed unlike the semi-vowels (y, w)
                    and we ignore the doubling of consonants and the indication of tension (Camps: 2011) .</div>

                <div class="desc">Tifinagh/tifinaɣ is a very old writing system used by the Numidians in North Africa
                    since
                    antiquity.Also called Libyan, this alphabet was able to survive and reach us through the native
                    inhabitants of this vast region who continued to use it.Through a large number of inscriptions
                    still preserved (eg fig.1), useful information about the language has been revealed claiming
                    that these ancient forms evolved into the current Tifinagh (Camps, 1992).</div>

                <div class="desc">Concerning the origins of the tifinagh, the problem is still not settled.Casajus
                    (2013) estimates that
                    the
                    Libyans would have created their writing system between the 6th and 4th centuries BC (Fig. 1) using
                    several
                    letters used at the time by the Phoenicians and the Punics and creating more.Amara (2020: 541) talks
                    about
                    a centuries-long gap in the estimation of ancient Libyan scriptures.She cites the parietal
                    inscription
                    of
                    Azib n'Ikkis du Yagour (Fig. 2) discovered in the Moroccan High Atlas by Malhomme in 1959, the
                    dating of
                    which has been placed at the Bronze II age.</div>
