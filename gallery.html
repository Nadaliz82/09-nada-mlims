                <h2>history status</h2>
                <p>In general, ancient tifinagh is considered to be very close to the current tifinagh of Ahaggar
                    (Algeria) and Ajjer (Algeria/Libya) (Claudot Award: 2011 ), and today's Tuaregs are able to
                    read and interpret it.

                <caption> Table of Tifinaghs (Tuareg alphabet), from Agali Zakara (1984)</caption>
                <p>Indeed, it was the Tuaregs who continued to use Tifinagh and it is thanks
                    to
                    them that
                    this
                    alphabet was able to survive until today.One can distinguish slight differences from one
                    region
                    to another , but even so, texts written in one region can be easily read and understood
                    in another.On the other hand, Tifinagh characters have been used to decorate both
                    women's
                    jewelry
                    and men's weapons and also to write small texts and love poems.

                <caption>The “Oriental” Libyan alphabet according to J.-B. Chabot</caption>
                <p>Tifinagh is a consonantal alphabet that has not ceased to evolve throughout
                    history
                    while
                    maintaining consistency at the morphological and structural level.In the Libyan writing
                    composed of 24 signs , the vowels are not transcribed unlike the semi-vowels (y, w)
                    and we ignore the doubling of consonants and the indication of tension (Camps: 2011) .

                <p>Tifinagh/tifinaɣ is a very old writing system used by the Numidians in
                    North
                    Africa
                    since
                    antiquity.Also called Libyan, this alphabet was able to survive and reach us through
                    the
                    native
                    inhabitants of this vast region who continued to use it.Through a large number of
                    inscriptions
                    still preserved , useful information about the language has been revealed
                    claiming
                    that these ancient forms evolved into the current Tifinagh (Camps, 1992).</p>

                <p>Concerning the origins of the tifinagh, the problem is still not
                    settled.Casajus
                    (2013) estimates that
                    the
                    Libyans would have created their writing system between the 6th and 4th centuries BC
                    using
                    several
                    letters used at the time by the Phoenicians and the Punics and creating more.Amara
                    (2020:
                    541) talks
                    about
                    a centuries-long gap in the estimation of ancient Libyan scriptures.She cites the
                    parietal
                    inscription
                    of
                    Azib n'Ikkis du Yagour (Fig. 2) discovered in the Moroccan High Atlas by Malhomme in
                    1959,
                    the
                    dating of
                    which has been placed at the Bronze II age.</p>
