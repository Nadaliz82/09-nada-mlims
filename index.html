            <h2>origin</h2>

            <p> <strong>Berbers</strong> or <strong>Imazighen</strong> <a href="Tifinagh.html">ⵉⵎⴰⵣⵉⵖⵏ</a>, are an
                ethnic group indigenous to the Maghreb
                region of North Africa, specifically <u>Morocco</u> ,<u>Algeria</u>, <u>Tunisia</u>, and <u>Libya</u>,
                and to a lesser extent <u>Mauritania</u> , northern <u>Mali</u>, and northern <u>Niger</u> . Smaller
                Berber
                communities are also found in <u>Burkina Faso</u> and Egypt's <u>Siwa Oasis</u>.[31] Historically,
                Berber (Amazigh)
                nations have spoken Berber languages, which are a branch of the Afroasiatic language family.</p>
            <h2> Name</h2>

            <p> The term Berber comes from the Greek: <strong>βάρβαρος</strong> (barbaros βάρβαροι barbaroi) which in
                Ancient Greece
                meant
                "non-Greek-speaking" or "non-Greek peoples". The Romans also used the word to refer to their neighbours
                to
                the
                north, in Germania (roughly the area that is modern-day Germany), as well as to Celts, Iberians, Gauls,
                Goths,
                and Thracians. Among the oldest written attestations of the word Berber is its use as an ethnonym in a
                document
                from the 1st century AD Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. Gabriel Camps argues that the name of the
                Berbers does
                not derive from "barbarian", as usually thought, but from the name of the tribe of the Bavares.</p>
            <p>
                In ancient and medieval times, the Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines all used words which are similar to
                "Berber" in
                reference to various tribes that inhabited “Greater Libya" (that is, the area which is now called North
                Africa), in
                areas where Berbers were later to be found. Although the following tribal names differ from the names
                used
                in those
                classical sources, they are nevertheless probably related to the modern Amazigh. The Meshwesh tribe was
                the
                first
                of these tribes to be identified by researchers. Scholars believe it is the same tribe that was called
                Mazyes by the
                ancient Greek writer Hektaios and Maxyes by the ancient Greek historian Herodotus. In Latin sources, the
                tribe was
                called Mazaces and Mazax, and was related to the later Massylii and Masaesyli. Late antiquity Roman and
                Coptic
                language sources record that a tribe referred to as Mazices (Coptic: ⲙⲁⲥⲓⲅⲝ) conducted multiple
                raids
                against
                Egypt. All these names are similar to the names used by the Berbers to refer to themselves, and are
                perhaps
                foreign renditions of that name: Imazighen or i-Mazigh-en (singular: a-Mazigh).</p>
